5. BONUS QUESTION:
-------------------------------
PropData
In either Javascript or Python have the function PropData(num) take the num parameter being passed and return all the numbers from 1 to num separated by spaces, but replace every number that is divisible by 3 with the word "Prop", replace every number that is divisible by 5 with the word "Data", and every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "PropData". 
For example: if num is 16, then your program should return the string "1 2 Prop 4 Data Prop 7 8 Prop Data 11 Prop 13 14 PropData 16". The input will be within the range 1 - 50.

Examples
Input: 3
Output: 1 2 Prop

Input: 8
Output: 1 2 Prop 4 Data Prop 7 8
